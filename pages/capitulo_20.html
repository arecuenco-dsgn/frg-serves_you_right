          <h1>
            <strong>Twenty </strong>“Let's go, let's go, let's go,
          </h1>
          <p class="paragraph">to the Atayde Hermanos. Circus Show! There's EXCITEMENT, there's FUN for the whole family…!”  </p>
          <p class="paragraph">Adolfo burst into his sister's room jumping up and down with a maniacal smile. Although it was Saturday, Lucía was lying on her bed watching TV. It was after 9 pm, and she was wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. Adolfo shook her as if she were a ragdoll.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What do you want?” she asked.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Spruce yourself up, we're going to a partay.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Where? It's almost ten, Fito.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">“To Luis’. A Day of the Dead shindig.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	It was not a bad idea to go out. Since her confrontation with Ricardo, she had no one to go out with. He had not called her in a week, and she was not going to call him, mainly because she didn't know what to do. She still had his ring, but she didn't want to give it back yet because that would force her to make a decision. Gabriel seemed to be ready to do anything for her. He was the true love of her life. And you cannot let your true love go, because according to what she'd heard, there's only one. What if she lost him forever? While she decided, she had started saving money from her allowances and just in case, she was asking for more from her dad with the excuse of final projects for school. In any case, one cannot live worrying about what people think. Too bad if it was scandalous: it was not her fault that everyone was so narrowminded.  She thought it would be nice to dance a little, have a little weed, some coke to distract her from her terrible dilemma for a while.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Okay. But I have to take a shower and blow dry my hair and everything.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Yay!” exclaimed her brother. “Hurry up.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She lathered up with her sensitive skin gel, slowly getting more excited about smoking and drinking a lot, maybe even taking some molly to let loose. She chose a lingerie set of a black push up bra and lace string bikini she bought in Paris, black leather pants, a tight black semi-sheer t-shirt with a plunging neckline, and stiletto booties. &quot;Only the whip is missing&quot;, she thought. She vamped herself up with smoky eyeshadow, lots of mascara, red lips. She put two drops of Opium behind her earlobes and one between her breasts, and she finished by decking herself out with earrings, rings, and bracelets.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Steady, Fido,” she amused herself, coming down the stairs. She opened the door to the kitchen as if she was about to sashay on a runway, anticipating Gabriel's face when she saw her dressed like a femme fatale.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Zenaida and the maids were fixing their own dinner, but Gabriel wasn't there. She realized she had dressed up for him.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Where's Adolfo?” she asked.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“They're waiting for you in the car, <i>Señorita</i>,” said Zenaida.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She didn't realize that her brother wasn't driving until she sat in the front seat and saw a pair of rat-colored pants in the seat next to her.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Sit with me here in the back, my little Lulu,” said her brother, patting the back seat. &quot;Unless you want to sit in the front with the driver&quot;.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía moved to the back. She felt like throwing up.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Gabriel will take us to the party and wait for us so we can get plastered in peace. Am I a genius, or what?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel stared at the window, so he didn’t have to accidentally see the faces of the siblings.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Fito,” said Lucía, choosing her words carefully, “isn't it a bit too much to ask Gabriel to wait for us? We can ask someone for a ride back. He needs to get up early tomorrow.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“If I am not mistaken, tomorrow is Sunday, and my pal here doesn't have to work. It's his day of rest. Right, bro?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“That's right,” Gabriel replied.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Well, I don't think it's right that we use the driver to take us to parties. Plus, you didn't ask me. You should have asked me first.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You bought him? How much did you pay?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Don't be a moron, Fito, you know he is my driver, and you have no right to tell him what to do. At least ask me first, dammit.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I thought you would love the idea,” said Adolfo.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Before Lucía could continue betraying herself, Gabriel interrupted them.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Where to?” he asked.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“To Bosques de Pirules, in Bosques de las Lomas,” said Adolfo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Do you know the way?” asked Lucía.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No, <i>Señorita</i>.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Adolfo snickered.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía tried to feign indifference and gave Gabriel instructions. Adolfo was looking from one to the other as if he was following the ball in a ping-pong match.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Stop it, Fito. What's the matter with you?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Nothing, I'm just admiring how stunning you look tonight. You're on fire. Isn't my sister a beauty, <i>carnal</i>?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“We're not there yet and you're already high. Just shut up already.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I have never been more sober in my life, sweetheart.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">The block near Luis’ house was lined with cars, some parked on the sidewalks.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Don't park too far away. We don't want to have to go looking for you,” Adolfo ordered.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I'll see you inside,” said Lucía, rushing out of the car.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	The terracotta flagstones that led to the main door were lit by votive candles and lined by <i>cempazúchitl</i> flowers and little sugar skulls. Two huge moth-eaten doors, almost as big as a church's, were wide open. Lucía prayed she wouldn’t run into anyone she knew, but she immediately bumped into Luis and several of her brother's friends with their respective girlfriends. She had to stop and air kiss everyone. She looked over the vast hall. Luckily, it was dark.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She needed a drink to calm her nerves. She felt as if a 7.8 quake on the Richter scale had cracked her meticulously built facade. Her knees were shaking.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">The bar was not hard to find. A barman wearing a black t-shirt with skeleton bones was serving drinks under phosphorescent black light. Lucía downed one tequila in a split second, no salt, lime or <i>sangrita</i>. The alcohol made her tear up. She had to calm down and plan a strategy. Maybe this was a sign that it was time to leave with Gabriel once and for all. She could go and look for him, pack her bags and flee with him in the car. And never see anyone ever again.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She locked herself in the guest bathroom. Votive candles bathed the room with a warm light. Mounds of sugar skulls smiled at her mockingly. How pretentious, <i>pinche</i> Luis, she thought. She looked at herself in the mirror. Despite the benign lighting of the candles, she looked like a ghost. Her face was out of order, her eyes swollen, her lips twisted into an anguished grimace. She felt dizzy, no doubt because of the tequila. Someone tried to open the door.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Occupied!” she shouted in a panic. She flushed the toilet and ran the faucet. She tried to fix her face.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel drove around the block and found a spot a block and a half away from the party. He had not dared to look at Lucía from the rearview mirror. He managed to see her from the back when she ran out of the car. Adolfo had asked him for the ride to the party as an urgent favor an hour before. “I have to ask my dad,” he had retorted, but Adolfo assured him he had already spoken with Agustín, and it was fine. He never mentioned that Lucía was coming until he got in the car and said casually that Lucía would be ready shortly. He should have left right after the fight with her.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	<i>I'm not going to sit around here como un pendejo.</i></p>
          <p class="paragraph">	He drove towards Avenida de los Bosques. He slowly pressed the pedal, aware of the patrol cars he had seen marauding on the empty avenues, listening to the roar of the engine as the car sped up to seventy, eighty, ninety kilometers per hour.  He turned on the radio at full blast, opened the sunroof and opened the windows. He hit the gas. The needle marked 100. He didn't see the bump with faded stripes. The car went flying and bounced off the asphalt. Though terrified, Gabriel confirmed that nothing serious had happened to him or the car and the adrenaline rush gave way to euphoria. For the first time since he arrived in that fucking house, he felt he was in possession of his own fate.    </p>
          <p class="paragraph">	The avenue narrowed and turned into a two-lane highway. Gabriel did a u turn, skidding. He drove fast down the wide avenue lined with mansions with guardhouses and alarm systems and dogs that are trained to maul intruders to shreds. Several side streets had been turned into private streets with security gates. He took an open side street and saw mansions that looked like spaceships, with round windows and triangular doors, haughty colonial haciendas with immense walls and pyramidal tile roofs, fairytale castles, houses made of glass, some one story high, others four. He felt like setting fire to them all and carbonizing everyone inside them.</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><i>	Rich people do whatever they please. They don't want anyone to go down their street, they have it closed. And they put a security gate with two starving morons whose job is to not let the raza in, unless they're there to fix the garden or do the laundry. We're a bunch of cowards. </i> </p>
          <p class="paragraph">	He drove around the residential streets, poisoning his conscience with the memories of the afternoons he spent with Lucía. He was sick of those two spoiled brats ordering him around. And he didn't like that his woman was going to marry that prick and he was going to have to be at their beck and call and get to fuck her once in a blue moon.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	<i>I'm going to give you one last chance, cabrona. Either you come with me when I say vámonos, or you're fucked.</i></p>
          <p class="paragraph">Lucía opened the door of the restroom and ran into Ximena. They looked at each other awkwardly, not knowing whether they should speak to each other or not.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What's up?” said Lucía.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What's up with you?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I'm good and you?” said Lucía with a broken voice.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She gripped her friend by the wrist. She felt an immense need to lock herself in the restroom with Ximena and let it all out.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Excuse me, but I need to go in there,” said Ximena, breaking free and closing the door of the restroom.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía felt abandoned. She ran out looking for Gabriel and walked the length of the street but didn't find him. Her heart sank, but standing in the night cold, she thought it was better if Gabriel disappeared with the car and never came back. Upon her return to the party, she saw Ricardo ordering a drink at the bar. A great confusion swirled inside her like the sand mixed with saltwater she once swallowed when she was knocked over by a wave. She went towards him, pushing against the crowd like a shipwreck who swims furiously towards a piece of driftwood.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Hello, Ricardo.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What's up, Lucía.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Can I talk to you?” she said.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I have nothing to say to you. I'm here to have a good time.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía started crying like she had not cried in years. She didn't know exactly why. She cried because of how she had hurt her poor boyfriend. She cried because she could not find Gabriel. She cried because her brother wasted all his energy in petty idiocies, she cried because no one understood her, because she didn't know what to do, because she was selfish, because all she really wanted to do in life was to fuck, because she did want a pretty wedding with lots of guests.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Some people stared at her as she bawled. Ricardo led her to a quieter corner, pushing her softly by the shoulders.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Let them see me cry, I don't give a fuck,” she babbled.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Shh,” whispered Ricardo, moved by his beloved's cascading tears.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I know I hurt you,” Lucía said to him, swallowing her snot.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	He didn't answer.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I didn’t mean to hurt you.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She was convulsed by another wave of heaving. Ricardo strived not to forgive her instantly. The banner of pride he was forced to fly to safeguard his own dignity seemed like a hindrance to him.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Yeah right, Lucía,” he said stoically, as he gave her a tissue.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I swear, Ricky. I went too fast when I wasn't sure if I wanted to have a serious relationship with you. I should have told you.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía blew her nose.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You treated me like shit. You said horrible things to me. You cannot treat me like this.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I didn't give you back the ring because I wanted to think it over and patch things up, I swear,” said Lucía.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Ricardo stroked her cheek and held her to his chest so tightly he almost crushed her. Lucía allowed him to kiss and caress and console her, hoping that her brother would discover her in that position and understand that he was wrong.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	However, at that moment, Adolfo was in the restroom of the master bedroom on the second floor, ready to snort a welcome bump, even though his first intention had been to keep an eye on his sister all night long. The Lombardos, owners of one of the biggest car dealership chains in Mexico, had a toilet imported from Japan with a heated seat that also sprayed your ass clean. Adolfo was pushing all the little buttons on the toilet while Luis was cutting lines with his American Express Onyx like an experienced <i>taquero</i>.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Adolfo ran the jacuzzi surrounded with mirrors in which there was ample room for four people. While the roman tub was filling up, he rummaged through the medicine cabinets and the drawers, examined the prescriptions and the cosmetics, found Xanax, stole several, and undressed. They snorted their lines and got into the hot tub.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Adolfo explained the reason for his euphoria:</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Lucía is fucking the son of Agustín.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No way! She stole him from you!” laughed Luis.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Indeed, <i>mon cher</i> Luis. And tonight, I am going to fuck them both over.”</p>
