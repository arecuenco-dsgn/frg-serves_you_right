          <h1>
            <strong>Twelve </strong>About six blocks away
          </h1>
          <p class="paragraph">from the house, Lucía jumped into the front seat.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Why do we have to go all the way downtown?” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Because we won't run into anyone there. It's less risky.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	They left the car in the underground parking of Bellas Artes and walked through the streets of the historic center. They went by the Downtown Hotel. Gabriel wanted to go in, but Lucía feared running into someone she knew. He started looking for a hotel. They went by a colonial building with a sign that said “Hotel Mónaco.”  </p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Here?” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía screened the facade.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I don't know what kind of a place this is,” she said.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's a hotel.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Ok, you check it out,” Lucía grumbled.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel crossed the big wooden doors and stepped into a cool inner courtyard with tiled floors. A small stone fountain gurgled in the middle of the patio. A stone staircase with wrought iron handrails led to the rooms on the second and third floors. Behind the faded wood counter that served as the reception desk, the price list indicated that a room was twice what Gabriel earned in one day.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's a bit expensive,” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“How much?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Three hundred and sixty pesos.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Must be full of fleas,” Lucía mumbled.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Check it out yourself,” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Is it for hookers?” Lucía asked disapprovingly.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I don't think so!” Gabriel replied.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">He pulled her by the hand into the hotel. Lucía felt relief as she saw two Scandinavian looking hippies coming down the stairs. Gabriel leaned on the counter and asked for a room. Lucía stood petrified with her back to the counter, aiming her nerves at the fountain.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“How many nights?” the manager asked casually, stretching his neck to look for luggage.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Only for today,” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's 360 pesos.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">His tone was strictly professional, but Lucía found it judgmental.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No problem,” Gabriel replied.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Excuse me, payment is required in advance,” said the man.	</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Yes. One moment.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel took out the last hundred-peso bill he had and continued digging in his pockets as if there still was money to be found in their depths.   </p>
          <p class="dialog">	“One second, please,” he said.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía pretended to be enthralled by the fountain.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I don't have enough,” whispered Gabriel. “I need two hundred and sixty.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía took out three bills and gave them to him without looking.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	The room reeked of Pine Sol. Most of it was occupied by a lumpy queen-sized mattress, blanketed in coarse grey wool. The rest of the furniture consisted of a wooden chair and a rickety armoire with four crooked hangers. The narrow bathroom was covered in white tile and included a half-used roll of cheap toilet paper, two threadbare towels and a tiny Rosa Venus soap bar. A slit that peered into a dark interior patio provided the very limited amount of natural light. On a drawer next to the bed there was a pitcher of water with two plastic cups and a red rotary phone.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía threw open the blanket to find out if the sheets were clean. They were thin and coarse and had a couple of patches but no hairs or stains. Gabriel let her inspect the room. When she finished her review, Gabriel held her and kissed her and started unbuttoning her blouse.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Calm down,” she pushed him away.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's not so bad, Luchita. Come on, relax.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía had done it in legitimate hotels in Valle de Bravo, Ixtapa, and Acapulco. She had done it one afternoon, paranoid and uncomfortable, in a park with yellowish grass in Bosques de las Lomas, and only once in an average hotel in the Colonia Roma with greenish carpeting and bedspreads with cigarette burns.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Do you have condoms? Which ones did you buy?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Jeez, Lucía, I'm not a fucking virus. I have condoms, okay? They're all the same. Do you always make your boyfriend bag it up?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	While Gabriel went to the bathroom Lucía checked the beds, the floor, and the armoire one more time. She looked through the slit through which there was nothing to see. She sat on the bed and listened to the echo of Gabriel's urine splashing in the toilet, followed by the sound of flushing water. She thought there was still time to escape but she stayed put. He came towards her and kissed and stroked her without embarrassment, roughness, or clumsiness. He laid her on the bed and laid on top of her, and they rolled in bed fully clothed, like awkward teenagers. Little by little they found patches of warm skin until they were in their underwear.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I don't understand how it took us so long to get to this point,” she panted.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía watched him undress and thought his white briefs looked a bit like a diaper. His ribs were sticking out of his torso; his elbows, shoulders and knees pushed against his skin like a soccer ball against the net. His belly was hollow, and his thick black bush contrasted sharply against his lean body.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She held very still while he put on the condom, torn between the panic of the consequences of what was about to happen and the urge to get him inside her; anticipating that miraculous feeling when he found the opening in her flesh by himself. Gabriel could not cease to be amazed at having her tangled beneath his body, and at being the reason why her hair was sprawled on the pillow like a web of black silk. He stuck his nostrils and his tongue in her armpits, acrid with sweat and perfume, he tasted the salty nectar of her cunt and the taste of clean soap on her skin. Lucía fucked without inhibition, bouncing violently on the bed, despite or perhaps because the sheets were prickly. She was turned on by the fact that she was in that dingy hotel without anyone's knowledge. She started touching herself and moaning louder. Gabriel matched the urgent rhythm of her breath until she exploded with a fearful howl.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Yes, come Gabriel, come inside me.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel swayed on top of her whimpering and trembling until he fell, exhausted.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	He hugged her and covered her in tender kisses.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“<i>Mi princesa caramelo</i><i>—</i>My princess made of caramel.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía replied with a long kiss. What could she answer? &quot;My chocolate chauffeur&quot;?  </p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Did you like it?” she asked.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	<i>Who doesn't?</i> he thought.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Did <i>you</i> like it?” he asked.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Of course... I loved it!” She looked at him soberly and added, “I like you a lot, Gabriel.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I like you too.”  </p>
          <p class="paragraph">	They remained braided together for a long time, nuzzling in the vapor of their sleepy bodies.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Lucía had left her bracelets and earrings at home. She had not brought her handbag or her credit cards. She had divided the money between the two front pockets of her jeans, just in case. After they left the hotel, she walked down the streets holding on to Gabriel for dear life, looking back on every corner, trying to identify possible kidnappers or policemen looking for their wages. Men stared at her ravenously or bumped into her on purpose to brush against her.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	They ran into the Zócalo, which she remembered visiting to see the Christmas decorations when she was a little girl. She had seen it from the car one night her daddy took them, in their pajamas, to see the holiday lights in Alameda Park. In the afternoon light it was somewhere between majestic, as they said on TV, and derelict. At each of its corners the portraits of national heroes made of colored lightbulbs still hung, commemorating the Independence holidays. A group of young men in loincloths and feathered headdresses was performing an indigenous dance with flutes, conchs, and pre-Hispanic drums. Beggars posted at the entrance of the cathedral whimpered with pathetic voices; native peoples, teachers, workers, professional protesters, all camped under indignant handmade signs they had hung from the cathedral fence.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía imagined herself going to confession inside the cathedral, the only church outside of the Basilica of Guadalupe and St. Peter in Rome big enough to accommodate her countless and gigantic sins. &quot;I just fornicated,&quot; she imagined whispering to the priest, and continuing filled with glee, “with the driver who works in my house, behind my boyfriend's back. I am a world-class sinner, father. Your rosaries can do nothing for me.”  </p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Aren't you starving, <i>mi reina</i>?” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Where can we eat?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You tell me.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Let me find out what's around.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía was not very familiar with the Centro, besides the Downtown Hotel which Ricardo liked and to which she could not take Gabriel. She remembered the Sanborn's de los Azulejos. She thought Gabriel was a bit alarmed by that suggestion.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Don't worry, I’m buying,” she told him.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Inside the grand covered courtyard of the restaurant, Lucía felt that everyone was gaping at them suspiciously, including the waitress dressed in a long, pleated paper skirt with colored stripes. Gabriel looked at the menu. The prices were shocking.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Order whatever you want,” Lucía said.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Well then: a Tlalpeño broth, some enchiladas, <i>sopecitos</i>, one steak Tampiqueña, a banana split and a pecan milkshake.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Don't be silly,” said Lucía.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Didn't you say, ‘everything you want’?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel ordered a tortilla soup and a steak Tampiqueña; Lucía, Swiss enchiladas.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Imagine,” said Lucía, “this was the house of a viceroy.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Relatives of yours, my love?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Seriously, we aren't that rich.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel burst out laughing.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I swear,” protested Lucía.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	They left Sanborn’s feeling satisfied and sleepy. It seemed to Lucía as if she had gone on a trip abroad, as if she was visiting an exotic and remote continent, like India or Africa.</p>
