            <strong>Fourteen </strong>Escaping with Gabriel
          </h1>
          <p class="paragraph">wasn't easy. She couldn’t take a single step in that house (which since things began with Gabriel felt as overpopulated as an anthill) without a relative or servant appearing behind a door. People lurked everywhere wanting to know where she was going, when she was coming back, how, when, and with whom.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">She and Gabriel lived roused by hope and exhausted by frustration, without being able to plan ahead, trying to find spontaneous moments to steal hurried kisses. Which is why Sundays were the perfect day to disappear with Gabriel. Half the servants had the day off. Her dad went to play golf. If Natalia didn't join him at the club, the manicurist came to do her nails at home.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">But sometimes Roberto either had a guilty conscience or wanted to ruin everyone's day and he'd organize a family lunch at the Miravista. On those days, the family arrived in three separate cars. Lucía in Ricardo's, Adolfo in his Jetta, and the Orozcos in the Mercedes.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Fito was always the last one to arrive, haggard and dehydrated. Lucía was in a foul mood of epic proportions for reasons only she could fathom. And Natalia defended Fito to get a rise out of her husband. When the hostilities began at the table, Ricardo fixed his gaze on his Tampiqueña steak, Roberto guzzled several tequilas and then showed his martyr face when the check arrived.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I'm going with my friend Chantal to a luncheon in Pedregal.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía dipped her <i>concha</i> in the yolk of her soft-boiled egg (Zenaida served them to her without the whites because she hated them).</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Chantal who?” her mother inquired.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Chantal Bellini. Her parents are Italian diplomats. You don't know them.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She had borrowed the last name from a brunch menu.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You're not seeing Ricky?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“In the early evening.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	If everything went well and people didn't ask too many questions, four o'clock would come and Lucía wouldn't be seized by the claustrophobic anguish that crept up on her all the Sundays of her life. She'd only feel sad when she came back from her romance downtown and found the house dark, her mom locked in her bedroom, her dad and brother gone, and her boyfriend's messages on her cellphone.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel had gone to the hotel by minibus and metro (Sunday was his day off and it was not wise for them to go together by car). He was very late. Lucía got creeped out waiting for him in the room, so she waited in the lobby, across from the reception guy who ogled her with vulgar complicity. She had been sitting on the edge of the little stone fountain for half an hour. Exasperated, she peeked out the big wooden door. Gabriel was walking calmly towards her, as if they had the rest of eternity to be together.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I brought you a Tin Larín. A sweet for my sweet,” said Gabriel, all smiles.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Look at the time,” Lucía replied.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“The minibus was late.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“We have no time! I'm supposed to see Ricardo tonight.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Oh, fuck that shit.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I have to see him at some point. They will suspect something if I don't.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Yeah, go tell your grandma that it is for <i>us</i> that you fuck the architect. I'm not that big a fool. Are you giving me the money or what?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I already paid.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No shit. Really?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía scowled and took the money from her wallet.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You better not,” said Gabriel, grabbing the bill.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What happens if I pay the guy one day?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“They'll think I am your private escort.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Don't be so macho.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She knew that Gabriel didn't have much money, but she thought that once in a while he could buy her a meal in a cheap place like Vips or at least a movie and popcorn.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I'm fed up with coming downtown. I'm fed up with this hotel,” she said.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“We can go to the Camino Real if you want.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“We can, but I'd have to pay for it, like I do everything else.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Why are you so stingy, with all the money you have?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I pay for everything, and you tell me I am cheap? Besides, I have no money. You know my dad gives it to me.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph"> 	“Come on, <i>tu papá caga lana</i><i>—</i>your dad shits money.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Again, the same story. What, you didn't save money in the United States? You have nothing left?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No. I have nothing left, go figure. <i>Vete al carajo</i>.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel left her talking to herself. She ran after him.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Gabriel! Wait!”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía started crying. The topic of money provoked tears of guilt. She always felt like the villain of the story, not only stingy and insensitive to her lover's shortfalls, but as if she were to blame for the fact that he didn't have a cent.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Come on, let's go to the room,” she said. “Here's the cash. Don't be mad.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You think I like having you pay for everything?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No. Please, forgive me.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel paid the reception guy and went up the stairs without waiting for her. He was lying in bed when she came in.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Fuck me,” she whispered, getting flushed just from expressing the thought.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Beg me,” he said.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Fuck me, I beg you,<i> te lo suplico</i>.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">He pushed inside her without putting on the condom. She writhed like a tadpole, she scratched him, bit him, and pinched him but she let him overpower her, turned on by their wrestling and by his naked sex pumping her insides without the rubber membrane that was the last barrier against their intimacy. Not without panic, she thought he might come inside her, and imagined his viscous seed spreading quickly inside her, trying to reach her ovaries. But he pulled out.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Satisfied and grateful, Lucía snuggled next to him under the sheets and showered him with kisses. The only sound they heard was the labored breathing of the boilers and generators. There he was right beside her, naked and placid as a sleeping baby, and she knew nothing about him: what was his life like, where had he gone to school, how had he grown up, if he had ever been in love before. She was afraid to find out, worried that this would increase the differences between them. On the other hand, she felt that in some way she already knew his story: a story of ugliness, cruelty, and deprivation, the story of all of Mexico's poor. Her mom used to say that Mexicans are a bunch of losers who don't know how to get ahead in life. Everything they touch, they turn to dust.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Why did you come back from the States?” she asked, rousing him.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She got ready to hear her lover's story, excited and alert like when she was a little girl and her daddy helped her with her homework.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Because I got deported.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“How?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“When I worked at a restaurant in Soho.”		</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Which restaurant? Maybe I know it.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Le Bistrot.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Doesn't ring a bell. Was it good?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Yes, very.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Were you a cook?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No, I was a busboy. I was going to be promoted to waiter.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And how much did they pay?” Lucía asked.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Seven dollars an hour. Minimum wage was eleven eighty.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And how much do you make here?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Not even worth mentioning.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Tell me.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Gabriel took a long pause.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Tell me. I want to know.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Two hundred dollars a month. How about that?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Even though math was not her forte, Lucía figured that Gabriel's monthly salary was less than the price of a so-so brand cocktail dress from Bloomingdale's.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's not a lot,” said Lucía.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's nothing.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Okay, tell me about New York. Isn't it the best?” she said.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's great once you get used to it. But at the beginning, it's a bitch.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Why?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Because those of us who are not there as tourists, like you, at first you don't know shit. You don't speak a word of English, you don't know anyone, and there are another eighty thousand idiots looking for work who are as desperate as you.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“How did you get all the way there?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I paid a coyote 1200 green ones to cross me over.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“How did you get that much money?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I saved, working with my mom in her juice stand. Then my brother and my uncle chipped in, plus some money that a friend loaned me.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And how did you cross?” Lucía asked.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Well, first you arrive at a town called Naco...”</p>
          <p class="paragraph"> 	“You are making this up.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I swear to God that's the name of that stupid town,” laughed Gabriel. “You want me to tell you or not? There in Naco, you stay at a hotel that the coyote gets you and you wait until they tell you when they're crossing you over. Three or four days jerking off. And once they let you know, you meet at night with a bunch of people, and you start walking in the desert. You can't see anything, and it's fucking freezing. And you walk and walk, and you don't get anywhere. You cross by sliding under a torn iron fence. And in the morning, the moment the sun rises, the heat is unbearable. The thorns of the cactuses stick to your clothes. You run into poisonous snakes. It feels like you got a red-hot iron on your head. People get tired. They faint. They get disoriented. They get lost. And the coyotes don't wait.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You didn't help them?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“At first, I was watching out for them, but they kept getting behind and if I stayed with them, we were all gonna get lost.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	He didn't tell her that it was women, some with little children, that came from who knows where in El Salvador or Guatemala, who asked for help.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You think they died?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I hope not. But with that heat, I don't know.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You didn't feel guilty leaving them there?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I did. But what do you want me to do? Would you have waited for them?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And what happened once you crossed over?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph"> 	“We got to a road, and they stuck us inside a van with no windows. We could hardly breathe, dying in the heat for hours. Then it stopped suddenly, and they opened the doors. I almost went blind from the sunlight. You could see some buildings in the distance bending in the heat like rubber. They told us that was Tucson and to separate to avoid getting caught by the<i> migra</i>. And they left us there in the middle of that oven. So, I started walking towards the buildings, no water or anything, alone as a dog. I made it to a neighborhood with houses that had swimming pools and I was so hot that that I took off my clothes, I jumped a fence, and I jumped in, in my briefs.  You have no idea how good that felt. I was so thirsty I drank water from the pool. I got out before anyone saw me, I changed clothes, and I headed towards the city.</p>
          <p class="paragraph"> 	“And did you find a job?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“In Tucson it was impossible. The <i>migra</i> won't leave you alone. I went to pick apples in Washington State. And then I went to Long Island. My buddy Leandro and I went to a town called Farmington which is about an hour and a half from New York City on the train. It was a dump. We found a house where another bunch of Mexicans were living. You had to walk like half an hour to a godammned corner of the town to wait until a gringo picked you up in a van and took you to work. Farmington was horrible, but twenty minutes from there, it was a different story. Mansions with pools and gardens. That's where they take you to mow the lawns and plant rosebushes and shit like that.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Two days after we got there, a gringo took Leandro and me to put grass in his garden. All day long with our backs hurting like hell, but at the end he gave each of us a 100-dollar bill. He hired us to paint walls and install air conditioners. He saved a shitload of money with us. He'd tell us,‘You're like little hardworking ants, tiny and dark.”  </p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Did you make a lot?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Honey, I had never had so much dough in my life. In four months, I saved like 3,000 dollars. But of course, being the moron that I am, I sent most to my mom, and I paid what I owed people.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And then?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“One morning a pickup truck came by with two blond jocks inside. They chose Leandro and your humble servant since we stuck together like dirt to a fingernail. They took us to a house under construction. We could tell it was abandoned. The yard was full of broken glass and used needles. We got a bad vibe, but there we go chasing after the dough. They ambushed us inside a barn, and when Leandro tried to run, one of the gringos punched him. The other one took out a chain. They left Leandro like a bloody pulp. They broke four of my ribs and they almost took my eye out. And you can't go to the hospital in case the <i>migra</i> is prowling. It was a shitshow.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía's eyes got clouded.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I'm not telling you this so you can pity me,” Gabriel said.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I don't pity you. On the contrary, I admire you. I wouldn’t have even lasted two minutes in the desert.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Of course not. There is no Zenaida there to carry your water canteen.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía pretended she didn't hear the comment.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Did you miss Mexico?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I missed my friends. And the food.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Not your family?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Honestly, no. They are a pain in the ass.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“How old were you?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Seventeen.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Lucía could imagine him, with his protruding ribs, working under the blazing sun.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Weren't you lonely?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I got myself some girlfriends.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Mexicans?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And gringas too.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Seriously?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Of course, over there it's a different story,” Gabriel said. “<i>Gringas</i> are much more laid back.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“<i>Son unas putas</i>.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Maybe, but they don't play hard to get so much.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Until that day, Lucía's opinion was that Mexico's poor insist on ruining their own lives by having dozens of children they can't afford. It had never crossed her mind to think of the sexual lives of Ignacia, Jacinta, or Zenaida. It was a taboo, like picturing her own parents copulating.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“How many gringas did you hook up with?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Lots. The <i>güeritas</i> over there don't look down on you like the ones here, baby. Like Kate, she was all over me.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Who?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“An Irish waitress who worked with me in the restaurant. Every time she arrived, she greeted me with a kiss on the cheek. And again when she went home at night. I used to call her Catalina.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And did you score?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Of course. She was my girlfriend. But the manager was an asshole gringo called Brian and he was after Kate. He saw that she was into me, and he started making my life a living hell. Once, I happened to talk back and the <i>cabrón</i> called ICE. One day, right during lunchtime, they showed up in the kitchen asking for me. And they arrested me, locked me up in a jail for six months and then they deported me.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Ricardo wanted to stay home and listen to music. Lucía didn't mind showering, putting on her creams and perfume and make-up all over again. It turned out that the more sex she had, the more sex she wanted to have. She was turned on by having been with Gabriel only a couple of hours before. She liked comparing her two lovers. She liked sniffing them, tasting them, and identifying their scents and flavors as if she were tasting wines. She liked being desired by two men. And she wanted to feel horny with both, although with Ricardo she didn't dare do half of the things she did with Gabriel in the hotel, and she had no idea why.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You look distracted, Lucía. Are you alright?” asked Ricardo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Yes, <i>mi amor</i>. I'm just a bit tired. I didn't sleep well.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Let me put on some chill out<i> </i>music, we'll have a little wine, and smoke a little weed. What do you want for dinner? We can ask the maid to fix something, or we can order sushi.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Sushi.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Cool. I have a wonderful sake that I brought from Japan. I can make you some amazing saketinis.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Just the sake, thanks.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I can add a slice of cucumber for the aroma.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I said just the sake!”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Ricardo smarted.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You just don't listen, Ricky. Let's go to your room.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She took him by the hand to lead him there. He didn't budge.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Not that I'm complaining, but once in a blue moon when I actually get to see you, it's either to have lunch with your family or to fuck,” he said.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Oh, so if a girl wants to fuck, she is a whore, and if she doesn't, she is a nun. Are you coming or not?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Ricardo made a funny frightened face.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">“Let me get the weed.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Ricardo told the maid to go up to her room. He ordered an amazing Japanese meal and as background music he chose an album with a woman whispering in French. Lucía would have preferred Luis Miguel, or a normal ballad, but Ricardo said those were cheesy. Her two lovers hated the music she liked. That's what they had in common.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía was intimidated by the perfection of Ricardo's apartment. It was like being trapped in a fashion magazine where everyone wears sunglasses and weird Prada clothes, and smiling is frowned upon. After he went to the door for the sushi, Ricardo came back to the living room looking triumphant.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Look what I found! Molly! Have you tried it?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	This is too much, thought Lucía. Only a few hours ago I was melting with the driver and now Ecstasy with this one.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Never,” she lied.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Do you feel like it?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Yeah, why not?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Let's take it after we eat,” said Ricardo.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	He placed the sushi artistically on his Japanese ceramic dinnerware with hammered metal chopsticks and linen napkins that matched his Scandinavian shot glasses. Lucía would not have minded eating straight from the plastic tray with the splintered wooden chopsticks instead of having to wait for Ricardo to stop being a Geisha. But once Ricardo started feeding her sushi and the sake had relaxed her, she found her boyfriend's penchant for the finer things in life very pleasant. After dinner, Ricardo split the pill in two and made Lucía drink a full glass of water. They hugged on the leather sofa waiting for the pill to kick in, listening to the phantasmagoric music. Half an hour later, a feeling of wellbeing descended on Lucía like a silk membrane. The music notes entered through her pores. Handsome, tall Ricardo, with his angelic curls coiled around his forehead, danced with her, following her moves with telepathic precision, which made her utter little yelps of joy. Their bodies brushed against each other, and the texture of his shirt and his breast below it was deliriously soft. Lucía felt that her own smile was going to drip down her chin like a juicy, ripe fruit. Their bodies floated like anemones at the liquid sway of the music. They were one organism. Ricardo kissed her softly. He tasted of sake and the sea. He caressed her as if she were made of glass.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You are beautiful, Lucía.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Hmm.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I can't believe my luck.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Me neither.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Ricardo gazed at her in awe, searching for her love in the depths of her eyes. She smiled sweetly at him. They gazed at each other for a long time, without touching, very close together.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I love you,” he said.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Shh. Make love to me.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	And he did, with delicious, sweet, tender slowness, their scorching skins melding completely, their mouths thirsty, the exquisite fever of their pleasure under the cotton sheets, cool as the water that smooths the pebbles in a stream. Lucía felt that in her heart there was room for loving more than one man, love to give and receive.</p>
