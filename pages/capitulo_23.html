          <h1>
            <strong>Twenty-three </strong>The sober three-thousand-dollar wedding dress
          </h1>
          <p class="paragraph">chosen by her mother (bone-colored, long-sleeved, buttonhole collar, a long row of chaste buttons running down the back) awaited her on a hanger. It was loose on her, even though they had given it to the seamstress more than once to take in several centimeters and even though a creature had been gestating inside her for about five months. Lucía observed everything that happened around her from above, as if she were a figurine in a miniature model of a residential development, the kind displayed at shopping malls. She was nothing but a playing piece in that perfect world of tiny moss trees and cellophane swimming pools. They could set her holding a tennis racquet next to a car, or on the lawn, or at the entrance of a luxurious residence, standing behind a man with a briefcase. It didn't matter. She was exhausted. She wanted to slit her wrists.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You are a romantic vision: vaporous, feminine, diaphanous, but the bags under your eyes are scary, <i>chiquita</i>. Haven't you slept?” said Flavio, the makeup artist.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Isn’t she still too pale?” asked the mother of the bride, who observed Flavio as he did Lucía’s makeup as if he were performing surgery.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Well yes, <i>está color axila de lagartija</i>—she’s the color of a lizard's armpit,” said Flavio. “But I will take care of that with my magic powders. Don't worry, <i>Señora</i>, we're going to make this child dazzle like a shooting star.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	The maids helped her fasten the veil. They gathered the train so she wouldn't drag it all the way to the garage, where an old-fashioned car festooned with lace, gladiolas and tuberose waited for her. Zenaida held her bouquet so she could get in the car.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You are very beautiful, <i>Señorita</i> Lulú,” she heard her say in a distant echo. “May God bless you. Here are some María cookies with <i>cajeta</i>, so you can eat something before the wedding.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Lucía levitates over the church's aisle, groggy from the tranquilizers. Her mother has instructed her how to reach the altar: a step and you stop, two steps and you stop. Her left upper lip is trembling. Her smile hurts. She looks sideways at the maids, who give up their seats for guests arriving late.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Her father reeks of alcohol. His arm is as cold and inert as a handrail. Since the morning he hit her, he won’t talk to her, won’t look at her and won't touch her. To control her tears, Lucía observes the gaggle of her mother’s friends, some wearing fur coats, although it's 2 pm on a sweltering Saturday in March.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Her mother wears a sequined chiffon dress straight out of Star Wars. She takes stock of everything everyone says, thinks and imagines. She is on Adolfo's arm, who smiles like a fool since the bump he just had with the groom has just kicked in. The in-laws look like they are at a wake. The only one who burns with joy is Luis Lombardo, her brother's “best friend,” who waits for her at the altar, thrilled to see his beautiful bride, whom he will take on trips, dress up, make over and parade, as well as his dashing brother-in-law, so elegant in his Hugo Boss tux, who he’ll have nearby to love for the rest of his life. Two for the price of one. ‘He took advantage of the clearance sale,’ a guest may have said.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Her friends Mercedes, Marifer, Fernanda, Viviana and Lolis shed crocodile tears. Did they cry like this at Ximena's wedding to Ricardo?	</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	A few days after the incident, Luis started showing up at Lucía's house with bouquets of roses and chocolate boxes. He was happy, courteous and sweet as he meted out the pills she needed to keep from going insane. Roberto and Natalia were alarmed at first, but soon they had to admit that Luisito was their best, and in fact only, option. Locked in her bedroom with him, weak from not eating, faint from drugs, or dizzy with the pregnancy, Lucía could feel how his throat would close when he forced himself to kiss her mouth. She could feel his repulsion every time he touched her. To punish herself, she urged him:  </p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Fuck me, faggot.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	The morning Agustín left, Lucía went to the servants' quarters while the rest of the household was deep in other chores. The walls were still swollen with damp, the tile floor frozen, the mattresses now bare, leaving proof of solitary dreams in their stains and grooves. Agustín was tying his cardboard box with rope. Lucía gave him an envelope with the fifteen thousand pesos she had saved.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“This is all I have,” she said to him, “but I hope that you can get Gabriel out of jail soon.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“He's not going to come out until God knows when,” said Agustín.	</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía burst out crying.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It was not Gabriel's fault. It was mine.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Agustín looked at her coldly.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Bail is set at 50 thousand pesos, if you really want to help.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	From then on, Lucía spent her days forcing herself to recreate the images of Gabriel, delirious with pleasure, his fingers forming delicate silk lace on her shoulders. Impatient with her imperfect memories, she would hug one of her pillows, pretend it was Gabriel, and would spend hours swearing her regret to it, showering it with kisses, stroking its cover with her hand burning with pain. Addicted to her daydreams, she masturbated obsessively and walked around with her panties permanently drenched in longing. And she thought, naively, that the little secret creature that she was harboring would be a miniature Gabriel to whom she would transfer all her love. But she did not dare visit him in jail.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Luis asked for her hand in marriage on Christmas Eve and a date was set for early March, shortening considerably the customary engagement period of one year. The wedding challenges overwhelmed her for months, although they seemed far more interesting to her boyfriend: whether to choose filet mignon with soufflé potatoes, or salmon en croute with shiitake mushrooms: birds of paradise or Thai orchids; what about the rings; the ringbearers; whether to celebrate it at the San Ángel Inn or the Four Seasons; photos, or video; dresses for the little flower girls. With epic reluctance she leafed hefty tomes of wedding magazines and interviewed florists and caterers. She let her mother-in-law and Luis make half the decisions and her mother the other half.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Natalia attempted to win her back by enlisting her in the wedding plans and acting sweetly, taking her out for coffee as if they were best friends. She was the only one that showed any compassion. Anything to keep up appearances.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">“I convinced your dad that since your in-laws will give you the house, as a wedding present we should give you the honeymoon,” she said on one of their prenuptial expeditions. “Your father thinks that the banquet is enough, but I think the honeymoon is classier, because the house is forever. Of course, the wedding is forever too, but it only lasts one day, while you will live in that house with Luis and your children, God willing, for many years. Luis told me you want to go to Tahiti and Bora Bora, which is a bit far, and a bit costly, I must say, but I think it's splendid, because you need a good rest. Forget about everything. Start afresh. And apparently, it is paradise. Besides, you will be able to practice your French.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Irma brought Gabriel food, soap, and toilet paper after giving a bribe or part of her food to the guards when they let her through, and once, after having to hike up her skirt and squat in front of the uniformed mangy dogs who checked her to see if she wasn't bringing in any weapons or drugs. Because she was the mother of an &quot;urchin,&quot; a convict without money, if she didn't pay, he barely got food to eat.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	His parents came to visit him one Sunday, together after years of hate. His mother gave him two egg and chorizo tortas and some Boings. Gabriel devoured one with hunger and grief and hid the other one for later. His father looked ashen. His mother's eyes were swollen from crying.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“How are you, <i>hijo</i>?” asked his mom. All her questions were one and the same: &quot;Did they rape you?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Why do you ask if you don't want to know?” he would have liked to answer.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Hanging in there, mom. Thanks for the tortas.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Your file is at the bottom of a bunch of pending trials of the judge,” said his father. The Orozcos want to screw you.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“But we met your lawyer, son, who will defend you,” said his mom. “He hasn't come to see you? He said he would.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“The <i>Señorita</i> gave your dad some money, maybe we can get enough for your bail.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Give it back to her. I don't want it,” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's like fifteen thousand pesos,” insisted his mom.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Serves you right for messing around with the lady of the house,” grumbled his dad.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Lucía looks back and for a few seconds, she thinks she glimpses a familiar figure standing at the doors of the church. The afternoon sun etches a halo around him. His posture is serene, still. Wisps of wind tussle his hair. Lucía stretches her neck, gets up, turns her body towards the church's door, her heart beating wildly.</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><i>	Come get me. Take me with you. </i> </p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Taffeta and lace rustle, the rumor of her fever of illicit love affairs, of her unbalance, threatens to be unleashed like a gale. The priest pronounces her name, Luis squeezes her hand. The apparition is just a popsicle vendor who rings the bells of his cart, hoping to attract sweltering parishioners. Lucía returns to her penitence and the buzzing subsides. She spends the rest of the ceremony playing, grateful for the distraction, with the psychedelic green and yellow spots that appear before her eyes, thanks to the sun.</p>
          <p class="paragraph"> 	The ring has been placed on her finger, she has eaten the flesh, drunk the blood, Luis has kissed her lips and lifted her gently by the elbow. Under the rain of applause and cheers of &quot;<i>Vivan los novios!&quot;</i> all that awaits her outside the church are poisoned rays of light.</p>
