          <h1>
            <strong>Twenty-two </strong>Adolfo and Luis put on fat terrycloth robes
          </h1>
          <p class="paragraph">and blow-dried their hair. Adolfo slapped his cheeks with one of Mr. Lombardo's colognes and Luis put on a very discreet layer of lip gloss that he took from one of the drawers. They snorted one last line and went back to the party. They saw Lucía dancing with Ricardo. He was holding her by the waist and stroking her back. They were kissing vehemently.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Luis raised his eyebrows.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I couldn't have planned this better,” said Adolfo smiling proudly. “I don't know what the hell Mestre is doing at this party, but I am so happy to see him.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Hadn't they broken up?” asked Luis.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	On the other side of the living room, Ximena was chatting with a purple t-shirt.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Look who's there. I can't believe it,” said Adolfo, pointing toward the strange couple that was talking at the bar.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Ximena,” said Luis.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Ximena and who else, <i>imbécil</i>.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Oh my god,” said Luis. “<i>El Chichifo Deluxe!</i>”  </p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Adolfo decided to circumvent Gabriel for the time being and ran down the stairs to intercept Ximena, who was heading to the garden. He grabbed her arm.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Who were you talking to?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Just now at the bar. Who was that creep? What did he say to you?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's Adrián's mechanic,” said Ximena. “I don't understand why they invited him.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“He is no mechanic. He is Agustín's son.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Oh, no wonder he looked familiar. And what's he doing here?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“He drove us. He’s shameless, the fucking Indian.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“He's super drunk. He even asked me to dance,” said Ximena.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And what where you doing talking to him?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Well, I thought he was out of place, so I went to ask who he was. Stupid Luis doesn't even know who’s in his house.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What has Lucía told you?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“About what?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“About him?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Nothing. She only said that the son of the driver is her driver.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And you had never seen him before?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I have my own driver and as you know, must use my own vehicle with my own bodyguards.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And why did you two stop talking?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What's it to you?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Isn't it because you hate the idea that this little <i>naco</i> is fucking her?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“How do you know he's fucking her?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I think I saw them kissing.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What do you mean ‘I think’? Either you saw them, or you didn't.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You knew it, Ximena.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I didn't know anything.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You knew it. Lucía told you.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I swear she didn't. We argued because I was upset at the way your sister treated Ricky.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I don't know if you’ve seen those two yet, but they’re all over each other.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Precisely today, that Ricardo had come to the party alone, and she had loosened up and flirted with him and he had been so gentle, so sweet, that <i>puta</i> had decided to steal him from her again. Unforgivable.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Do you think it's right that my sister and the gofer are fucking?” said Adolfo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I think it's in the worst taste, but I'm not surprised: your sister fucks anything that moves.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What should we do?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Do? I don't know, Adolfo. I think we need to tell him to leave discreetly. Tell Luis to tell the guards to throw him out.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Lucía buried her face in Ricardo's shirt and breathed his dapper aroma of cologne. She closed her eyes and swayed to the music as if it and Ricardo's arms could protect her from the chaos around her.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I missed you so much,” said Ricardo. “I thought of calling you a thousand times, but I was too hurt.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It was hard for me too.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><i>	I already said I'm sorry, stop going on about it. </i> </p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I love you, Lucía.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I love you too.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Ricardo's tongue started exploring her mouth. For a brief moment, Lucía felt a great weight lift from her shoulders. She would go back to her regular life; to eat sushi and drink cosmos, buy new clothes without feeling guilty, tan on the bow of a sailboat in Valle de Bravo every weekend. In the end, they can't take anything away from you. True, she would miss terribly Gabriel's passion, his eternally melancholy air, his playful smile, his warm embrace; those impossibly fleshy and quivering lips that drove her wild. She would miss his hypnotic voice when he called her &quot;princess,&quot; his agonizing culminations, the tenderness with which he gazed at her after making love.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Ximena elbowed her way through the undulating throng to reach Lucía and Ricardo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Lucía, I gotta tell you something,” she whispered in her friend's ear.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“We're back together,” said Lucía.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Your driver is here. He was drinking at the bar two minutes ago. He's wasted,” whispered Ximena.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Where is he now?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I don't know. I can't find him.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Where's Adolfo?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“He saw me talking to him a while ago. You must tell your driver to leave before all hell breaks loose,” said Ximena.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	And in that moment, they both saw the black mane approaching, its wisps framing the tormented brow, his lids halfway open, the whites of his eyes shimmering with anger. Lucía wanted to soothe him, kiss his hair, drink his sweet saliva, comfort him. But she didn't budge. She tried detaching herself from Ricardo, who floated in ecstasy and had not realized that the driver was staring at them as if they were a horrifying insect and that his brother-in-law was running towards them.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Take the car and go home,” Lucía said to Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Don't order me around, these are not work hours, milady,” Gabriel snapped.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What the fuck are you doing here, you miserable bastard?” said Adolfo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Leave him be, Adolfo,” responded Lucía, with a mix of recklessness and panic. “Don't start.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Ricardo watched the three of them with utter incomprehension. To everyone's surprise, Gabriel opened his mouth.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You can go fuck yourself, you fucking faggot. Are you coming with me or not, Lucía? Let's go!”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía hesitated briefly and shook her head no. While Ricardo understood by the driver's face, Adolfo's agitation, and Ximena's shock, that his girlfriend had cheated on him with the driver, while he debated whether he really needed to pretend to want to beat him up to save his tainted pride, while he resolved the conflict between his use of reason (preserve your dignity, don't stoop to his level, don't get dirty) and the vertigo of his humiliation (send him to the hospital, fuck her up), Adolfo had already drawn the gun he had borrowed from a corner in his father's closet and was aiming at Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	A couple of girls screamed in panic, but the music was so loud that many people were oblivious.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Calm down, Fito, put that away, please,” implored Lucía.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What's wrong with you, Fito? Put that thing down. What's going on?” said Ricardo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Let's fight like men, you stupid fucking fag,” exclaimed Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Put the gun down, Adolfo,” ordered Luis. “We don't need another tragedy in this house.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's okay, Luigi. Look, I put it back. This is a family issue.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Adolfo put the gun back in his groin. Its weight made his pants hang down and show the black elastic of his designer briefs.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Fito, let's leave right now,” begged Lucía.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I’d advise you to shut up, Lucía, if you don't want to see blood.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Adolfo was playing the role of dishonored firstborn with authority, although to Lucía he sounded as if he was imitating a cops and robbers show on TV. Everything seemed like a ridiculous performance in which she was also playing a role, badly. She noticed that a crowd had assembled to watch like passersby gaping at a traffic accident. Her gaze fixed on Gabriel's, who had frozen in front of the gun with an expression more daring than fearful, as if he also thought that Adolfo's drama was ridiculous. She didn't dare look at Ricardo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Give me the gun, Adolfo,” Luis demanded. “And if you're going to fight, do it outside.”   </p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Adolfo gave the gun to the host, who took out the bullets expertly and stored them in his pocket.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Listen, <i>cabrón</i>, I did not invite you to this party. You already left. Beat it,” Luis said to Gabriel, snapping his fingers in his face.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Let's go, Lucía,” repeated Gabriel, ignoring Luis.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What do you mean, let's go?” screamed Ricardo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Ricky…” Lucía whimpered.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“This Indian put his hands on you?” asked Ricardo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“If you are going to fight, get out,” insisted Luis.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía was frightened but her mind was very alert, as if she’d snorted two lines of coke. She had run out of tears.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I fucked her and better than you, asshole,” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	An incredulous buzz arose among the onlookers.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“He's totally wasted. Who could even imagine?” said Lucía.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Ricardo felt as if he had been thrown into a pigsty. His body convulsed in a spasm of nausea.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I would never do such a thing, ever,” insisted Lucía.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel did not understand that her humiliating arguments were meant to protect him.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I have fucked her in her bedroom and mine and at the Mónaco Hotel thousands of times. She is dirtier and easier than a stray bitch in heat,” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Ricardo doubled over, covering his mouth with his hand to rein in the torrent of vomit that he emptied into the parquet anyway. The audience bellowed. Lucía tried to help him and took him by the arm, but Ricardo pushed her away and made his way through the guests, without looking at her. Ximena ran after him. Gabriel decided to lunge at Adolfo and punched him in the ribs, his jaw, his legs. Adolfo defended himself by kicking, pulling hair, and throwing punches that didn't land. Luis allowed a few seconds of this grotesque scene to go on but soon lost his patience and pounced on Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Shit, man, it’s on!” someone shouted.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Leave him alone!” Lucía screamed at her brother and Luis. But Gabriel was already lying on the floor shrunken like a fetus near the puddle of Ricardo's vomit, taking cover from the kicks and punches of Adolfo, Luis, and several other guests.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Adolfo took the car keys from Gabriel's pants pocket. Lucía tried convincing them to let him go. But the Lombardos had a friend in the Judicial Police and Luis had his personal phone number, so instead of two relatively inoffensive police officers, two leather-jacketed <i>judiciales </i>arrived at the scene. Adolfo and Luis said that this drunk individual had entered the premises without permission, and that he had harassed several young ladies. Gabriel complained that Adolfo had threatened him with a gun, that Lucía was his girlfriend, but they barely listened to him, because the others said &quot;What gun? What girlfriend? Look at him officer, he's drunk, he is just a resentful domestic worker.” Then, from between the crowd appeared the diminutive Amanda Lombardo, her eyes red from drugs, who accused Gabriel of abusing her next to the altar to the departed. The officers decided to take him away. Adolfo, Luis and Ricardo assembled a fat wad of cash and gave it to the commander because, despite the preferential treatment, the officers of the law requested a contribution for the home visit, assuring the victims that with it the intruder would be remain safely detained. Ogling her as if he was going to suck every bone in her body, the burly and pockmarked officer asked Lucía: “Were you also accosted and sexually abused by the boy?” Lucía denied it with a barely audible voice and suggested to the officers to let him go; he hadn't wanted to harm her at all. But the bribe was already in their pockets.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	The next day, her father sent her mother to get her out of bed. He sat Lucía and Natalia in the comfy leather sofa in his studio.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What's wrong, Lucía?” inquired her father. “Why are you so bent out of shape over the kid? He went to the party to pester you, insulted your brother, and you are crying over him. I want to know why.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Because the police took him away. He didn't do anything.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Why did he go to the party to look for you?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“He wanted to leave, he wanted to let me know he was leaving.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Why did you take him to the party?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Ask Adolfo, dad. It was his idea.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And what he said about the hotel downtown?” asked Roberto. “That's why you convinced me to let him drive you around?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía did not answer. Her impudent eyes met her father's.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You are a whore,” he said to her.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“That's how you raised me,” replied Lucía.	</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	In one step, Roberto breached the sofa where his daughter was sunk in her pajamas and slapped her so hard, her teeth shook. Lucía hid her hot, humiliated face between her legs. Her father had never hit her before.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Tell me what that bastard did to you,” her father insisted.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“He didn't do anything to me,” Lucía bawled. “We did it to each other.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You want to be slapped again?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía raised her face.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“He didn't fuck me. We fucked.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Go to your room if you don't want me to beat you to a pulp,” his father warned her, his fists shaking with rage.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“This is what happens when you let your heart bleed for the children of the servants,” Natalia said, livid with anger.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía stood up with her fragile suit of armor made of hate and walked slowly to the door.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Don't think I don't know that your brother is a disgusting rat faggot,” said Roberto. “But I swear to you Lucía that I will make sure that miserable son of a bitch rots in jail.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Serves you right,” said her mother. “Maybe now you'll learn to stick with your own kind.”</p>
