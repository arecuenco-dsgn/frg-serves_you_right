          <h1>
            <strong>Fifteen </strong>Gabriel touched the wrinkled picture
          </h1>
          <p class="paragraph">in his pocket that he’d got from Lucía after a lot of begging and swearing that he would hide it in a safe place. Lucía, radiant in a black bikini, was posing on the creamy sands of Acapulco. In fact, the only reason he wanted to meet with Moco and Bolillo was to show off his woman. His lifelong friends: they were all going to hit the States together, until they bailed on him. Later he found out they were resentful, making fun of his trip. He found them on their eternal break outside of Flacher, Moco’s brother’s body shop, where they were busy taking cars apart.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What's the deal with this bro? He is a fucking schmo. He prefers Uncle Sam to the nopal. Fucking loser, <i>güero </i>wannabe, you live in Las Lomas and you never come see me, you are not my homie,” sang Bolillo, showing off his doubtful talent as a rapper. He wanted to hug Gabriel but held back.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Motherfucker, since he got here from the other side, he thinks his shit don't stink,” said Moco.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“At least I’m not the one who bailed,” said Gabriel extending his hand in peace.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What brings you here, <i>Güero</i>? Did you come to hand your mom some dirty cash?” said Moco shaking his hand.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No, I came to say hello, homes. See what you're up to.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Here we are, practicing automotive engineering, as usual.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And your raps, Bolillo, how are they going? Have you been signed by the Banda Machos record label?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Keep laughing at me, <i>cabrón</i>. At least no one would have kicked my ass like that, motherfucker.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You would have scared yourself to death before you got to the border, <i>pinche gordo maricón</i>—you fucking fat faggot,” interceded Moco.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	As if they had slept together.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And how's life in las Lomas treating you, <i>güey</i>? What do you do?” said Bolillo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I'm a driver.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“With your old man, right? And what ship do you captain?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“More than one: a Focus, a Jetta, a BMW, and a Mercedes. And, once in a while, an Audi TT.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel began to savor his little revenge.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No shit. They work your ass off at the car dealership,” said Bolillo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Your bosses, they shit money, or what?” asked Moco.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Well, yeah, they're something else. They wipe their asses with 500-peso bills.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“If you lift anything, you gotta share,” said Bolillo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No way. I am a trusted employee,” Gabriel replied.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Yeah, a fucking boy scout,” said Moco.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And what's up with your old lady, Moco? How many creatures did you bring into the world already?” asked Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I already have three <i>enanos</i>, dude. But one is not Lety's so don't open your mouth.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“How about you, Bolillo?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Not even a hooker will go anywhere near this one,” answered Moco.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Well, I got a broad like you bitches have never seen,” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Imported or domestic?” asked Bolillo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Imported from las Lomas.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Fuck you!”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“She's my boss, <i>cabrón</i>.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Are you screwing the <i>Señora de la casa</i>?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Her daughter, <i>güey</i>.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You think we're <i>pendejos</i>?” said Bolillo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Her name is Lucía. Wanna see her picture?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel took out the photo from his pocket and was delighted by the astonished faces of his friends.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Come on, <i>güey</i>, you stole this,” said Moco.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Don't believe me if you don't want to.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“She sucked it already?” asked Bolillo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Many times.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Sss, you fucking liar,” protested Moco.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's for real. How much do you want to bet this is my bitch?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“A million dollars,” said Bolillo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“A thousand pesos,” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Deal. How are you going to prove it?” asked Moco.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I will introduce her to you.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Maybe she is a hooker you hire to put on a show,” said Bolillo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You are going to meet her in person. Next Sunday in Chapultepec, so it's not too far for us. At the entrance of the zoo, around eleven am. Yeah?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	He closed the bet with a handshake for each friend.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Start getting the dough because you're going to owe me a thousand pesos. Five hundred each.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	All week long he dreamt of the moment they would see him approaching, Lucía's hand in his. He did not expect them to pay up and didn’t care. This would shut their holes forever.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Let's go to my room,” he said to her the following day, guiding her up the service stairs.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You’re nuts,” she said.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I always go to yours. Now it's your turn.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Agustín had taken <i>Señora </i>Natalia and Zenaida grocery shopping and the maids were cleaning the house, deafened by the vacuum cleaner. Lucía followed him up the winding white tile stairs that seemed like an endless spiral when she used to play hide and seek. In fact, they were no more than ten narrow steps. The servants' quarters, which she had not set foot in since then, still reeked of gas and damp. As she walked into Gabriel and his dad's room, she remembered that her childhood furniture had ended up there. Lucía bounced against the mattress of her old bed. It was looser and lumpier. The headboard still had the stickers she had put there in elementary school; the lamp was still decorated with Smurfs. Gabriel hardly fit in that tiny twin bed. Lucía remembered that when she first had discovered how to touch herself, in the same position she was in now, in that very bed in the dark, the Virgin Mary and all her own family would appear above the headboard. Sister Márgara, the priest confessor, her dad, her mom, her girlfriends, Ximena's parents and even her pediatrician, would gape at her with long necks and disgusted faces.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Hurry up, Gabriel, I am freaking out that someone will come in.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel took his time and held on as long as he could. She had one of those orgasms that fizzle into a shudder. As she got dressed, Gabriel proposed the idea to go to Chapultepec, omitting certain details he did not consider relevant to divulge.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“There are too many people on Sundays,” replied Lucía.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“We always do what you command,” Gabriel complained. “I've never been to the zoo. We get there early, we see the little critters and then we go to the hotel, okay?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">As he got in the car three blocks away from the house, Gabriel was disappointed to find Lucía at the wheel in her jogging suit, without make up.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You dress up for Ricardo, but for me you go out like a sack of potatoes.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I am not going to get all dolled up to go to Chapultepec!” she rebuked him. “We're going to undress anyway, no?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I'm just saying I like it better when you put yourself together.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Whatever. You drive.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía had tied her jacket around her waist like a schoolgirl. A plastic patch in the shape of a turquoise heart bobbed in the middle of her breasts. Gabriel held her by the waist, and they went into Chapultepec, among the stalls of fried snacks and sodas, soap bubble vendors, baskets with giant <i>chicharrones</i> as rough as elephant ears. The leaves of the ahuehuete trees rustled in the breeze. Metallic pinwheels spun flashes of light, silver balloons bounced happily, shimmying their cartoon characters against the blue sky. Gabriel squeezed her hand, stroked her hair, rubbed her back, kissed her head. These overt displays of passion in front of &quot;The Great Mexican Family&quot; embarrassed her.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You're on me like glue today.”  </p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel saw them from afar. Moco and Bolillo were looking for him among the crowd. He got near enough for them to discover him spontaneously and as soon as they saw him with her, he stopped and kissed her at length. They approached, amazed. He greeted them as if he had not seen them in years, with hearty handshakes and backslaps.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Wow, no way! What up, homes? Did you come to see the little baby panda? Lucía, let me introduce you to my friends, Beto and Toño, better known as Moco and Bolillo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Hello,” Lucía smiled uncomfortably. Moco had a long and ghoulish face, and Bolillo was chubby and spongy, just as their nicknames indicated.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“A pleasure,” said Moco, extending his hand. Bolillo imitated him.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía shook hands.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“They're my boys from the neighborhood,” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Oh, which one?” asked Lucía. She hadn't yet asked Gabriel where he came from.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“San Gregorio Tepehualco,” said Bolillo.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	In sixth grade, her school had organized a Three Kings toy drive and the nuns had taken the girls to deliver gifts in that slum. Sister Márgara had called it a &quot;poverty belt.” Lucía remembered the slum perfectly. The students and nuns got off the school bus among clouds of dust and hungry dogs with hanging teats and swollen bellies. The only half-paved street was the main street. The students, uniformed with pleated skirts and white blouses, walked on their toes to avoid getting mud on their moccasins. Some of the &quot;prosperous&quot; houses were ramshackle gray brick cubes with windows protected by iron bars. The other houses were huts made of metal and corrugated cardboard. If they needed water, the neighbors had to take their buckets to a pipe truck. They stole electricity from the lampposts. The girls went into a typical household. It was a metal hut with a dirt floor with a brazier in the middle, chipped pewter pots, improvised shapeless beds behind ratty curtains, and a TV set with terrible reception turned on to the Channel of the Stars. The nun noted that despite their poverty, the inhabitants of the house kept it clean.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	They went by a minuscule grocery store that sold Chiclets, Chaparritas del Naranjo sodas, Sabritas potato chips, green bottles of bleach and Jabón Zote<i> </i>soap bars. The grease-streaked counter, in which hosts of flies buzzed and ants walked freely, displayed moldy bread and squashed Twinkies and Gansitos. They didn't buy anything.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía thought with a shudder that perhaps one of the scrawny kids that got their toys and then got in line again; perhaps one of those kids that leered at them with mistrust when they got off the bus and later, once they brought out the boxes, slathered sticky smiles on them, that maybe one of those cheating kids, hungry for toys, could have been Gabriel's little sibling. The voracious leers of Moco and Bolillo reminded her of the ungrateful and filthy looks of the teens that interrupted their street soccer game to whistle at them and scream obscene innuendos, at the girls and the nuns. What if she had seen them once before?  </p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Have you been?” Moco asked rhetorically.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No,” lied Lucía.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Let's take you there,” said Gabriel. “And you'll get to meet my mom.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Oof, the <i>suegra</i>,” said Bolillo making a terrified face.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“She's a sweetheart,” said Moco mockingly.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía glared at Gabriel with hatred. He implored her with his gaze not to make him look bad in front of his friends.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Didn't you want to go to the zoo?” she asked Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I'd rather you see my barrio. We can come here any time.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	They moved away from the group to confer.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Come on, Lucía, don't make it hard for me. We'll take them in the Focus,” insisted Gabriel. “I have never asked you for anything.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You did it on purpose,” grumbled Lucía.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I did not! Come on. Be a good girl. These are my best friends. I haven't seen them in years. Just a little while and we'll leave, so you can see where I grew up.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	In the car, Gabriel slid the seat back and reclined, stretching his arm to reach the steering wheel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“This is how your brother drives, like a pimp,” he said to Lucía.</p>
          <p class="paragraph"> Gabriel hit the gas.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It really rips,” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Don't go so fast,” she said.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“My brother-in-law is a fag,” said Gabriel to his friends. “As Lucía says, he feels like the last Coca Cola in the desert.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Your wheels are cool, Lulú,” said Bolillo, steering the conversation off the topic.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Thanks,” she replied. She did not remember which one was Toño and which one was Beto. Bolillo looked like a good person. Moco looked like a criminal.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	After crossing the Viaducto and Tlalpan and several unknown arteries, they arrived at an area of the city she no longer recognized. She did not know which way was west or east and had no idea where they were. They went deep into narrowing streets, pockmarked by holes filled with dirty water and full of traffic bumps you can't see but you definitely feel. The houses were painted brightly: mamey orange, lime green, Mexican pink, lemon yellow. Some of them had gilded metal lining on the windows, others had iron bars. They passed tire repair shops, chop shops, glass shops, beer depots, kiosks, and a gym called “Jonhy’s,” where there were apparently aerobics, bodybuilding, yoga, and self-defense classes. Stray dogs sniffed inside garbage bags strewn on the sidewalks. Gabriel parked in front of an auto repair shop.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Welcome to the beautiful barrio of San Gregorio Tepehualco,” said Gabriel. “Here on your right, you can observe Flacher's world famous automotive repair center. Yours truly was born two blocks away from here.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía wondered who owned the cars parked on the streets, some of them of quite recent models. Perhaps they were stolen. She could not understand how else they could be there.  She pictured herself on the front page of the Casos de Alarma tabloid, naked, bruised, covered in mud, next to the mugshot of her alleged rapists and murderers, better known as Gabriel, Moco, and Bolillo, three thugs frightened by the flash of the camera at the prosecutor's office.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	As for Gabriel, he held his woman by the waist as if he had purchased her at a slave auction.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“How do you like our hood?” he asked his girlfriend. “Lucía went on the subway with me for the first time the other day. She was scared shitless,” he said. “She refuses to ride the minibuses. She thinks someone will kidnap her. Right, my love?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Shut up,” said Lucía.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Your mother-in-law lives around the corner,” said Gabriel, heading there.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía didn't want to guess which one of those miserable cement cubes belonged to Gabriel's mother. She prayed with all her might that the <i>señora</i> would not be home. They stopped in front of a washed-out blue cube with a white metal door. Gabriel knocked. He put his ear to the cold metal.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“<i>Mamá!</i>” he yelled.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	The pale woman who opened the door was as diminutive as Gabriel. From her he had inherited his fleshy lips, his melancholy eyes, and his ashen complexion. She was wearing grey cotton jogging pants with a white stripe on the side, a short-sleeved blouse with little flowers, and black plastic flats. She eyed everyone with suspicion.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Hi Ma! We were passing by and came to say hello,” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	His excitement escaped his pores the minute he saw her long-suffering face.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“<i>Mamá</i>, let me introduce you to my girlfriend, Lucía Orozco.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía saw a flash of surprise light up the woman's eyes. She was very young but looked old. Lucía guessed she was in her late thirties.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Nice to meet you, <i>Señorita</i>.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Me too,” whispered Lucía.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Afternoon, <i>Señora</i>,” said Moco.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You’re not going to invite us in?” said Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I haven't swept, <i>hijo</i>.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“We came all the way from las Lomas, <i>mamá</i>.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She let them in. Once her eyes got used to the dark, Lucía saw she was standing on a floor made of cement that was unevenly smeared like cake frosting. She could make out a broken gas range. The oven door had been ripped away and now it worked as a pantry. In the middle of the room sat a chipped wooden table and two chairs. A dresser held a small TV set, and a curtain separated the sleeping area. Gabriel handed her a chair.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“<i>Siéntate</i>.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Can I offer you something to drink?” asked her <i>suegra</i>.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No, thank you very much.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“If I had known you were coming, I would have fixed something to eat.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Don't worry, <i>Señora</i>.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“A little Coke?” insisted Irma.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Moco and Bolillo thought it amusing that Irma, whose<b> </b>temper<b> </b>was legendary, suddenly became so polite.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Okay, thanks.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel's mom took a single glass covered with fingerprints out of the oven, and from the shadows, a half-empty two-liter Coke bottle, the kind Lucía detested because they always go flat. She barely wet her lips. It was just syrup, and it was lukewarm. Lucía had a sudden, intense cramp. A cold sweat blossomed through her pores. Her bowels rumbled. She attempted a feeble smile.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I need to use the bathroom,” she whispered to Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Behind the curtain,” he showed her.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía took her backpack with her, for the Kleenex and hand disinfectant she had inside. The metal door opened towards her, screeching against the cement floor, making it hard for her to get inside the enclosure, dark and narrow as a catacomb. Lucía looked for the light switch, which she did not find. She discovered a white toilet bowl, without a lid or a seat. She did not find toilet paper. She peeked into the plastic barrel next to the toilet and saw it was half full of water. Inside floated a little bucket. She tried holding it in, walking around in circles to see if the pain would subside, mortified because she knew that otherwise the noise would thunder through the entire neighborhood. But the pain overcame her. She had no choice but to squat and expel the inferno that was piercing her entrails. <i>The fucking sushi.</i> She felt the explosion blast out in quadrophonic sound.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You okay?” She heard Gabriel's voice on the other side of the door.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Yes. Coming.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She patted the cold sweat off her forehead and as she splashed water from the bucket to the toilet, the toilet water started rising, which made her panic. Evidently, this was divine punishment for breaking the social, moral, or whatever order she had broken. She kept up her fight with the little bucket until finally the water receded, gurgling.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“We thought you had escaped,” said Moco when she came back.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's time for us to leave,” said Lucía. “Thanks for everything, <i>Señora</i>.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You are welcome. If you will excuse me,” Irma disappeared behind the curtain.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Bolillo asked Gabriel:  </p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Shall we go for some beers at Burro's dive? To celebrate you won the bet.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	By the looks in Gabriel and Moco's shocked faces, Bolillo realized he had fucked up.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What bet?” asked Lucía.  </p>
          <p class="dialog">	“None,” Gabriel replied.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What did you bet? Did you bet something about me?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No, nothing, really.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	His friends started laughing nervously.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“How dare you, Gabriel?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	If she had brought her cellphone, she could have called an Uber, but she didn't because she was afraid it would get stolen in Chapultepec.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Give me the car keys.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel knew it made him look like an idiot, but he gave them to her.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Wait&quot;.  </p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía went out and started walking towards the car. Gabriel ran to catch up with her.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Why did you do this?” she asked him.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I don't know. I wanted to show you off to my <i>cuáis</i>. I wanted them to see what a fine woman I have,” he replied.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“This is over,” said Lucía.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She got in the car and left without him.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">The lights in the living room were on. Lucía peeked through the kitchen door and saw her mother, her father, Adolfo, and Ricardo conspiring in the living room. It was not the first time she’d come home under hairy circumstances. She had presented herself to her parents, several relatives, and friends of the family high, drunk, or both more than once, and like her brother, she was an expert in mimicking the most inconspicuous normalcy when the situation warranted it. For now, her concern was that she smelled like a sewer and that they could see she had been crying with panic and rage.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	She came in the room dragging her feet, as if she had been wandering in the desert.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Lucía, where were you, <i>hija</i>? Ricardo has been waiting for you,” said her father.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“We didn't have a plan today,” said Lucía, sinking into a sofa.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I left you several messages,” said Ricardo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“We went to the movies, and I turned it off.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“The only person in Mexico that turns off her phone at the movies. What did you see?” asked Adolfo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Some gringo bullshit, I don't remember the name.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Tell us the truth,” demanded Natalia. “Were you in an express kidnapping?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No, <i>mamá</i>! I was with Ximena and her bodyguards.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And you went out with Ximena wearing that?” said Adolfo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What do you care? Why are you interrogating me?” replied Lucía.    </p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Her parents looked at each other mysteriously.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Well, we'll leave you two alone,” said her mother. “Come on, Adolfo.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">The four of them smiled as if they were in on something.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I missed you,” said Ricardo, sitting next to her once they were alone.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I missed you too.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I don't understand what the hell you do on Sundays.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía sighed with exhaustion. Ricardo cradled her in his arms and kissed her emphatically. When she opened her eyes, a little black velvet box was on her lap.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What is this?” she said.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“What do you think?” he replied, melting with excitement.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía froze.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You don't want to see what's inside?” asked Ricardo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Ricky...” she said faintly.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Open it, <i>mi amor</i>.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Lucía opened the box with shaking hands. Inside she found a ring with a considerable diamond.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I designed it. The base is platinum.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph"> 	“Did you speak to my parents?” she said.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">“I only told them I had a surprise for you, but I think they guessed.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Ricardo kissed her hands.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Marry me, Lucía. I want you by my side.&quot;</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Lucía burst out crying. His eyes also filled with tears. He put the ring on her finger. Lucía felt her fate was sealed, as if she had tossed a coin and that was what she got. The end of it. She thought she heard Gabriel's footsteps going up to her room, although that was impossible. She hid her face in Ricardo's chest and cried.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Is that a yes or a no?” asked Ricardo.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's a yes,” said Lucía. “It's a yes.”</p>
