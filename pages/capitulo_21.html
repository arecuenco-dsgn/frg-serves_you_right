          <h1>
            <strong>Twenty-one </strong>“All by myself”, 
          </h1>
          <p class="paragraph">by Eric Carmen. “I'm not in love” by Ten CC. “I don't know how to love him” with Yvonne Elliman. It seemed they had programmed the songs in Radio Universal to make fun of his misery. Gabriel turned off the car and got out to breathe the night air, which around there was as biting as in the countryside. He leaned on a car from where he could see the house. A group of noisy guests was ignoring the guard in a suit and tie who was asking them to go inside to not disturb the neighbors. “Yeah, soon, man,” they would say, and continue screaming on the street. He could hear the rumble of the music and the indistinct hubbub of the guests, and he could picture Lucía flirting and dancing in those clothes she never wore for him.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	He crossed the street. The group of rich kids looked him over to see if they knew him. With every step he thought they would close ranks and not let him in, that they would ask for explanations, his ID.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	<i>The thing is to walk in as if I owned the place</i>.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	They stared but didn't say anything. The guard reviewed him for a fraction of a second and said:  </p>
          <p class="dialog">	“May I help you?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I am a friend of Luis and I'm here for the party.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	The <i>guarura</i> looked at him resentfully but let him in. By the garage there was a Tizoncito tacos catering truck, about 20 meters from the main door. Gabriel followed the scent of the <i>tacos al pastor</i>. The garage had been turned into a little town square festooned with colorful paper banners and food stalls, earthenware pots with stews, tables with big glass barrels of aguas frescas, baskets full of traditional crystalized fruits, <i>acitrón, calabazate, </i>and candy: <i>natillas, pirulíes, alegrías, pepitorias</i>. Gabriel dove into the hungry crowd and took the opportunity to order four pastor tacos with everything, two sopes, and two quesadillas, freshly handmade. They were served to him with inquiring faces, but he got his food.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	He crossed the enormous garden, amazed at the rows of votive candles on the wrought iron balconies and by two tall torches that spit fire at the main entrance to the house. A bronze sculpture of an indigenous woman wrapped in a <i>rebozo</i> waited for him undaunted at the door. She looked like she was about to stretch her arm to beg for a handout.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel went into the house, borne by his own adrenaline, emboldened for having cleared the first hurdle, having enjoyed a fine dinner to boot. It was so crowded that he could not take two steps without bumping into someone. In the dark, the bright gazes of men and women rested on him briefly like fireflies. He gazed back at them. Nothing like keeping your head down to give yourself away, he thought.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Indeterminate shadows huddled around a fireplace. In the back of the living room more people were dancing, and further away he could make out the blue aura of a swimming pool. He couldn't find Lucía or Adolfo. From the other side of the room, a phosphorescent skeleton was serving drinks, lit by black light. He went towards it.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	The skeleton hesitated for a second before offering him something to drink. Gabriel, who had been hiding in the dark, looked down and saw that his white t-shirt had become a big violet neon sign.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“One Don Julio, please.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	As soon as he got it, he moved away from the light. The promise of unlimited amounts of free booze and food distracted him briefly from his purpose. He snuggled up to the side of the bar and ordered another tequila. He walked like a lizard, sticking to the walls of the cupola of the vast foyer, decorated with hand painted flowers and angels. August paintings of somber fruits and dried flowers covered the walls in which six niches housed bloodied saints or painted wood archangels. Searching for Lucía among the shadows, Gabriel arrived at a traditional Day of the Dead altar covered in <i>cempazúchitl</i>. In the middle of the altar was a picture of a young man posing proudly next to a racecar, his helmet under his arm. Below the photograph, organized in symmetrical mounds like the ones fruit vendors assemble in markets, there were packs of Lucky Strike, Tin Larín chocolate wafers, Japanese peanuts, and baggies of Chamoy, placed in a halfmoon around a bottle of Porfidio tequila, a bottle of champagne and a bottle of Victoria beer. Lying at the base of the altar, over a bed of yellow petals, were a Paulina Rubio compact disc, a minuscule bikini, a bottle of eau de cologne with an unpronounceable name, and a collection of trophies and miniature racecars. Gabriel was mesmerized by the details of the short, privileged, and depraved life of this individual.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Did you know my brother Adrián?” inquired the nasal singsong of a rich girl.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	For a moment, Gabriel assumed it was not directed at him, but no one else responded. In the backlight he could make out the silhouette of a petite girl of about sixteen. She looked like a squirrel, her dainty nose sprinkled with freckles. She oozed the smell of weed.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I used to see him around,” muttered Gabriel.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“He was totally insane,” said the girl. “Do you know how he died?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“How?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“He was coming from a party in Tecamachalco, completely wasted, and at the Monte Líbano bridge, he didn’t realize he was in the wrong lane and tried to avoid the car coming at him. He crashed against the rail and fell off the bridge into the ravine. He took the guy who was driving in the other direction and his wife with him, so he orphaned baby twins. The Mercedes was crushed and Adrián was taken out in shreds&quot;.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel was silent for a few seconds and then asked:  </p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Did you make the altar?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No way! It was my brother Luis. I wanted to make an altar for those poor people my brother murdered right next to this one, but they didn't let me. I'm Amanda. What's your name?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Lorenzo,” he replied to the two shiny, dilated pupils.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“You want to dance?” said Amanda.</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><i>	Shit, I'm a hit with the princesses tonight. </i> </p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Without waiting for his answer, Amanda put her hands on Gabriel's shoulders, getting close enough to start arousing him. He took her by the waist, and they swayed slowly, ignoring the frantic music. Amanda smiled goofily and gazed at him as if she were discovering a specimen never seen before. Little wisps of her dry cigarette breath went into Gabriel's nostrils in rhythmic puffs. Gabriel pressed her lower lip between his teeth. Her spit was sweet and smoky. She clung to him, and he held her as if he wanted to break her spine. He kissed her hard, sticking his tongue almost all the way to her uvula.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	He would have liked to crush this little thing in his arms until her bones splintered, kiss her until he choked her, and tear off her little nose in one bite. But her smell of fancy perfume reminded him that he was there to take his woman by the hair if necessary.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I'll be right back. I'm going to get a drink,” he said.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	The skeleton looked at him with increasing suspicion but had not denied him any drinks yet. With his third tequila in hand, Gabriel went out to the garden, hypnotized by the serpentine reflections in the water. Cempazúchitl flowers floated in the pool like orange anemones. There weren't too many people in the garden. Three guys were passing a blunt in a dark corner and talking about a trip to the Caribbean. Gabriel approached. They stared at him with distrust but did not dare to confront him, and when the blunt finished going around, he joined their circle in such a way that they had no choice but to share it with him. He gave two hungry puffs and passed it on. An awkward silence choked the conversation, and since no one wanted to start it again as long as he was there, he moved away from the trio and hovered around nearby.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel walked deep into the garden and found a wooden bench under a leafy tree. These people had their own park with swings and seesaws and everything. The icy dampness of the grass pierced through the rubber soles of his sneakers and into the cracks on the soles of his feet. He got goosebumps. He felt each of his bones get numb, the cold freezing his marrow.  He gaped for an eternity at the luminous dance of the waves in the water, another eternity at the ghastly shapes the chimney exhaled into the murky sky. His own vapor mimicked the breath of the chimney. The privileged stoners standing in a corner of the garden were also shivering. <i>Their stink is not made of diamonds and their cold is not made of silver. They shit, piss and bleed just like the poorest loser. Their come, their snot and their tears are just as salty. In Mexico, the poor are resigned to be treated like shit because they are the color of shit! On TV everyone is white. The presidents are white. The owners of the banks are white. Businessmen are white. The kids in the commercials, blond, blue-eyed, freckled, white. Even the maids in the telenovelas are white. Miss Mexico, white. The women that sing wearing miniskirts so short you can almost see their throat, showing their belly button with their tits as hard as soccer balls, white. The garbage sifters, brown. The servants, drivers, nurses, gardeners, street sweepers, policemen, supermarket baggers, beggars, street venders, knife sharpeners, balloon sellers, taco makers, plumbers, cobblers, waiters, maids, guards, cooks, ice cream venders, fire-eaters, shoeshines, organ grinders, bricklayers, sweet potato venders, peons, peasants, garbagemen, caretakers, secondhand clothes vendors, in their vast majority: brown. Chocolatey, cinnamoned, coffee-like, chipotle and molasses-looking brown. </i> </p>
          <p class="paragraph">	The thought of his girl lost in the crowd took him out of his reverie. He had a mission to accomplish. He headed towards his loyal friend, the skeleton.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Can I get another tequilita and a Victoria?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	The skeleton eyed him sorely and burrowed his arm in the ice cooler as if he had to descend to the underworld to grab the last beer from the devil himself, although it seemed that there were plenty of beers at the bottom of the icy water. He put the beer on the bar but did not open it for him. Gabriel reached for the bottle opener with his arm.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I'm out of shot glasses,” said the skeleton.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“In a plastic cup like those, brother, no sweat. Am I a guest or not? You are going to pour me all the drinks I order, and more, <i>cabrón</i>.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	He paused, amazed at the speech that flowed so articulately from inside him.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Fuck, brother,” he continued. “I'm here in my black Jetta with my stereo and my sunroof and my magnesium rims and I live in Parque Vía Reforma 2347, Lomas de Chapultepec, Miguel Hidalgo County, Mexico City, Planet Earth, Solar System and I am fucking one of your boss’ friends like a king. How about that?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Get the fuck out, you fucking drunk stoner,” mumbled the skeleton.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel took out a crushed Alas from the pocket in his t-shirt. While he looked for his matches, a girl with curly blond hair came up to him and asked for a cigarette.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	<i>I'm telling you, they can't resist me.</i></p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Hey, can I bum one?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Of course. They are unfiltered, though.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“It's fine. Everybody's out.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Of course. Otherwise, the <i>güerita</i> would have never spoken to him. Gabriel smoothed the cigarette between his fingers, gave it to her and continued searching for his matches. While she investigated him, she took out her lighter and gave it to Gabriel, but she didn't light up. Gabriel thought he had seen her before.</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Who do you know here? Are you a friend of Luis?” she said.</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><i>	The questioning has begun. </i> </p>
          <p class="paragraph">	<span lang="es-ES">“No, I'm a friend of Amanda and Adrián; </span><span lang="es-ES"><i>que Dios lo tenga en Su gloria</i></span><span lang="es-ES">,” mumbled Gabriel. </span> </p>
          <p class="paragraph"><span lang="es-ES">	</span>“What's your name?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Lorenzo. And yours?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Ximena. Lorenzo what?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph">	<i>Ximena what, eh? Is she Lucía's friend? Oh shit...</i></p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Lorenzo Mendoza Bonilla, at your service.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“And how did you know Adrián?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I was his mechanic.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><i>	That's what you want to hear, right, chata? </i> </p>
          <p class="dialog">	“I see. So you were invited to the party.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Here I am, no?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No, yes, for sure. And are you having a good time?”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Yes, it’s chill. Wanna dance?”</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><i>	Why the hell not? While we're at it...</i></p>
          <p class="dialog">	“No, thanks, I just needed a cigarette.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“As many as you want. I'll give you a light.”</p>
          <p class="dialog">	“Thanks, I'm gonna smoke it outside.”</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><i>	Fucking stuck-up bitch. Call the suited-up gorilla and have him kick me out if you don't like it. </i> </p>
          <p class="paragraph">	Gabriel rubbed his eyes and gave out a fatalistic sigh. He could use this warning of the gods to escape, or he could take Lucía with him forever, after disfiguring her fag of a brother with his fists. He dove into the dense fog, dizzied by the smell of pot, perfume mixed with sweat, alcohol-laced breaths, and hormones stirred by the sounds of a slow song in English.</p>
